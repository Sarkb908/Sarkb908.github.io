	<p style="color:white"> This screensaver is called "Sunrise" and it represents the sunrise from both the exterior and interior perspective of the horizon. At the begining of the piece, you are viewing the sunrise from outer space as it transitions into a sunrise that you'd view from the beach. It gets brighter from the sun and your perspective of the sunrise shifts from the outside of the earth to within. I did this piece based on both my interests in the universe and calming visuals that could be presented as a screensaver. I like the idea of keep my view abstract as it can translate a different experiance to each and indivisual viewer. Initially, I would have liked my transition between the colors to flow more gracefully, so the screensaver slowly transitions over a long period of time.
