	<h1>AQUASLIMES</h1>
	<p>Aquaslime is an amazing source of satisfaction. You can receive ASMR tingles by poking it. It comes in many colors and you can add much more to it. Aquaslime can be made in many different ways but a great recipe to create this satisfying object is to use any amount of glue that has PVA. Along with that you must use borax solution which you have to make with 1 cup of water, and 2 teaspoons of borax powder. You can purchase the borax powder on amazon. Aquaslime has a very precise recipe where you cannot add too much borax solution  (activator) at once with the glue or else you will not create the satisfying slime, only a rubbery mess. Adding only a little bit of activator at a time will do the job. Why does aquaslime satisfy others? You may still be wondering why, and not only does it have fabulous ASMR but it soothes and calms people when playing with the slime. It will relieve stress to those who need it. Aquaslime is definitely something worth it if your looking for a great hobby or to help your daily life! </p>
