	<p> “Because I could not stop for Death,” a poem by Emily Dickinson meets OULIPO, a group of writers and mathematicians who created formulas in which writers can recreate the literature in any way they please. The one recreated here is “N+7” where the reader replaces a noun in the sentence with the 7th noun found after it in the dictionary. First the user approaches the initial page which presents the original poem. The nouns are marked in red, which jumps to the 7th noun in the dictionary when clicked. With this the user can recreate Emily Dickinson’s poem and now become the writer.

	<p>There are a number of combinations that can be made with the formula “N+7” in use and here are the 7th nouns in the dictionary.</p>

	<p>When the user completes their writing, they may move onto the next page which contains a description of OULIPO and N+7. The final page is illustrated with a quote by Lawrence Wiener that captures the essence of the formula that can applied to writing.
