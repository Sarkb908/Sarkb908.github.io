	  "One of the most popular OULIPO formulas is “N+7," in which the writer takes a poem already in existence and substitutes each of the poems substantive nouns with the noun appearing seven nouns away in the dictionary. Care is taken to ensure that the substitution is not just a compound derivative of the original, or shares a similar root, but a wholly different word. Results can vary widely depending on the version of the dictionary one uses."
